# Hi there <img src="https://github.com/TheDudeThatCode/TheDudeThatCode/blob/master/Assets/Hi.gif" width="29px">
I am a full-stack developer student, currently halfway through the Programming university degree in the National Technological University of Argentina. I am expanding my knowledge in front-end, back-end development and PostgresSQL.
My strengths are the development of desktop applications using the C# language and the .NET framework.
